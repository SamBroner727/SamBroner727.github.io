                                Sam hails from New York City (whats up!) and currently studies at Tufts University. Growing up Sam was not very cool, but thankfully he has grown to love computer science!

                                Every summer, Sam works at a sports camp in the Berkshires called Camp Lenox. While there, he leads a group of 40 7th grade boys and a staff of 10 counselors through their daily activities. Sam also gets a heavy dose of rest and relaxation and focuses on his jump shot.

                                In his spare time Sam drinks coffee, plays basketball, and hangs out with his friends. He's often found grooming his facial hair or regrowing his facial hair after he accidentally shaves it.
